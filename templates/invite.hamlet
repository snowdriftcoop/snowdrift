                Our invitation system generates private codes which users can redeem to gain further roles on the site.

                Permissions are project-specific, so users can have different roles for different projects.

                To invite others:

                    Enter information in the field below about who you are inviting and why.
                <li>
                    After you click "generate", you will be given a link which you can send to the invitee.
                <li>
                    Note: each invitation can only be used once, so you must generate a new link for each person you wish to invite.
