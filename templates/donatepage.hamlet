<h1>Donate to Snowdrift.coop

<p>
  Once we launch, we will use the same funding mechanims as other projects.
  For now, we gratefully accept donations to help get us to the launch.

<h2>Our current funding
<p>
  We ran a
  <a href="https://snowdrift.tilt.com">
    successful campaign
  at the end of 2014, and the co-founders continue to donate personally
  and volunteer substantial time without compensation.
  We currently have a budget just barely enough to fund a couple (underpaid)
  developers and cover some legal expenses along with a few other misc. items.
  See our
  <a href=@{WikiR "snowdrift" LangEn "accounting"}>
    accounting page
  for details about our budget and how we use the funds.
<p>
  Although the formal fund-drive is over, we can still provide comparable
  rewards for new donors. Please
  <a href=@{ProjectContactR "snowdrift"}>
    contact&nbsp;us
  with any questions.

    Note: Snowdrift.coop is incorporated as a Michigan non-profit cooperative
    but does not have federal tax-exempt status.
    Unlike a 501(c)(3) charity, donations to us are not tax-deductible.

    Note: the button above is convenient and works with or without a
    Paypal account, but using it costs us a 2.9% + $0.30 fee.
  To skip the fee, log-in to Paypal and send funds to
  aaron@snowdrift.coop funded by your bank or Paypal balance
  (not by credit card or paypal credit) and marked as a gift.

<p>
  Dwolla is U.S.-only and requires some delay and set up with a bank account
  (no option for credit cards)
  but charges <strong>no fees at all</strong>.
  They do seem to use some proprietary JavaScript, unfortunately.
