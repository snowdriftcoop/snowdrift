<h1>Delete Account

You can delete your account by pressing the button below.
<span .text-warning>Please note that we will not be able to restore it.
Your submissions (such as comments and wiki edits) will stay on the
site but will be assigned to the special "deleted user." If you want
to delete them as well, now it is a good time to do so.

<form method=POST action=@{UserConfirmDeleteR user_id hash}>
