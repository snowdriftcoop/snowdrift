                <h3>Summary
                <p>
                    <strong>Snowdrift.coop is a new fundraising system dedicated to Free digital works.
                    Today there are robust movements dedicated to Free Software, Free Cultural Works,
                    Open research, and Open Educational Resources;
                    but there is a need for better funding.
                    The main challenge in fundraising is just getting people to commit.
                    With so many organizations asking for our money, it is understandable that most of us are hesitant.
                    So we've designed a system to reduce the risk of jumping in and pledging your support.
                <p>
                    Instead of one-time campaigns, we are focused on supporting projects long-term.
                    With Snowdrift.coop, each pledge starts out very small and only increases when more donors join.
                    This way, matching is achieved across the whole community, and nobody is unfairly burdened.
                    Each donor knows that their pledge gets everyone else to chip in more.
                    Regular ongoing contributions are calculated and paid out to projects monthly.
                    To faciliate this, each donor will place funds in a private account from which donations are drawn.
                <p>
                    In line with our emphasis on both community values and individual freedom, we will be run as a cooperative.
                    We will also ask everyone to follow a basic honor system.
                    All projects will be required to use Free/Libre/Open licenses and to be transparent and accountable.
                    With these elements in place, we hope to bring supporters together in a way that has not been possible with other funding systems.

                <p>
                    With the internet, we have great opportunities to democratize access to ideas, culture, and technology.
                    There are many success stories, but there are still many issues.
                    Issues of freedom, privacy, and economics online are far from settled.

                <p>
                    The cost of distributing digital works is often negligible,
                    but the costs of research, development, and ongoing support are still present.
                    Blocking access until payment is made is one way to get funding,
                    but that has negative ramifications for openness, sharing, and freedom.

                <p>
                    <strong>If a program or a creative work is valuable, it will be that much more valuable if it is free to access, to share, and to improve.
                    Today, we have excellent free resources available,
                    but many free projects struggle to compete with better-funded restricted-access alternatives.
                    In principle, all the funding could just go to free resources instead;
                    but if access is free, how do we get everyone to chip in to support initial and ongoing development?

                <p>
                    Free projects can ask for donations, yet while some people volunteer time and money, many others freeload.
                    This is nothing new. It happens with all sorts of organizations, group projects, and social situations.
                    And people are hesitant to chip in if others aren't going to do their fair share.
                <p>
                    So we are creating a novel fundraising system to address this dilemma.
            <dt>

                    In English, the word "free" is often associated with
                    <em> free of charge,
                    but we are also concerned with other freedoms: access, use, sharing, and modification.
                    This confusion with the English word "free" is often clarified by using the Romance language term
                    <dfn> libre
                    (as in liberty) to contrast with
                    <dfn> gratis
                    (zero price).
                    We often use the term "Free/Libre" to emphasize our intended focus.
                    The term "open" is often used to imply the same freedoms, although this term can also be unclear.
                    Open resources are not Free/Libre if they are openly accessible but restricted in terms of use, sharing, or modification.

                <p>
                    The Internet offers amazing opportunities for global collaboration.
                    The possibilities are demonstrated by well-known examples such as Wikipedia.
                    Unfortunately, many people view modern media with assumptions that come from the familiar physical economy.
                    The metaphor of "property" has been imposed inappropriately on ideas and digital works.

                <p>
                    <strong>Our free market economic system is fundamentally based on scarcity.
                    Two people cannot both eat the same apple.
                    Other items are not literally consumed, but you cannot wear my hat while I wear it.
                    Thus scarcity leads to pressures of supply and demand and the rest of market economics.

                <p>
                    Of course, not everything is scarce. Air and sunlight are practically limitless.
                    Human ideas are also not strictly scarce (although development time and effort may be).
                    For all of human history we have freely shared stories and songs.
                    Sure, people try to keep secrets or to control other's thoughts or words;
                    but history has shown us the great value of being more open and of protecting indivdual freedom.
                    Not only is respecting freedom more ethical, but free societies are also better able to collaborate and prosper.
                    Even when controlled or secret, ideas do not work like physical property.
                    Learning, using, and sharing ideas does not consume them.
                    Giving an idea to someone else does not deprive you of the idea.

                <p>
                    The conflation of ideas with physical goods developed in part because of technology.
                    Preliterate communities spread ideas through stories and songs with no physical container.
                    The printing press made books the first physical mass medium several hundred years ago, but literacy was still slow to spread.
                    The rest of our published media are all quite new.
                    Recorded sound and video have existed for only a couple human generations.
                    The "intellectual property" metaphor is a modern concept developed just as
                    physical media containing audio and video recordings came to rival
                    live concerts, live lectures, and live storytelling.

                <p>
                    Thanks to digital technology, recorded content has now been essentially freed from its containers,
                    but our laws and cultural assumptions have not been updated to respect this change.
                    Rather than embrace the natural implications of digital media,
                    publishing companies have become entrenched with the old physical economy through reliance on <dfn>artificial scarcity</dfn>.
                    This was achieved by (A) extending existing copyright law to apply to digital media
                    and by (B) the development of Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) technology.

                <p>
                    Imposing artificial scarcity on digital works has three effects:

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Through artificial scarcity, works distributed digitally can be funded via the same market economy as physical goods.
                        Because it isn't a natural fit, this business model can be problematic, but it works in some cases.

                    <li>
                        Access and creative derivations are restricted in ways that have no financial benefit to the publisher.
                        Blocking users who can't afford to pay a license fee doesn't help the publisher economically.

                    <li>
                        By controlling access and restricting modifications, publishers gain power.
                        For example, software publishers may institute features that violate user privacy
                        or stop users from doing things with the software that the publishers don't like.
                        If the source code is secret and/or modification is legally blocked, then the only
                        choice users have is to take it or leave it (and you may not even have this choice
                        if the software is required in your work or school).
                        These particular problems are less prevalent in the physical free market economy.

                <p>
                    Only the first of these effects is ethical.
                    The second and third effects are detrimental to a free society.
                    Defenders of copyright and patent laws acknowledge this on the surface;
                    their arguments focus on economic concerns.
                    Publishers do not publicly state that they want power over readers.
                    They do not express interest in reducing access as an end in itself.
                    Their primary claim is that they need artificial scarcity in order to make money and thus to fund initial authorship.
                    Thus, our goal is to acknowledge and address this concern.

                <p>
                    Aside from artificial scarcity, the primary economic model for funding digital works is
                    to tie connect to the rest of the economy through advertisements.
                    This may not be bad in principle, but the reality is problematic.
                    Ads often rely on psychological manipulation via titillation, fear, and/or dishonesty.
                    Most online ad systems violate the privacy of internet users in order to target particular audiences.
                    Many ads encourage careless consumption.
                    Ubiquity of commercial advertising is itself a problem as it pollutes our cultural space.
                    Reliance on ad-revenue creates serious conflicts of interest for authors
                    as they end up more beholden to advertisers than to the rest of the community.
                    Limited advertising that carefully avoids these problems may be acceptible but is just not capable of significant funding.

                <p>
                    Another common business practice today is to release works freely
                    and then sell physical accessories or special services such as technical support.
                    Yet while businesses based on support may be profitable, this setup creates a conflict of interest;
                    if your income comes from support services, you may be less inclined to create easy-to-use, well-documented software.

                <p>
                    Many developers and creative artists also ask for open-ended voluntary donations,
                    and this can be remarkably successful in some cases, but often donations are unreliable.

                <p>
                    In founding Snowdrift.coop, we thought about how to achieve a better system.
                    We want works funded without problematic restrictions or conflicts of interest.
                    We also want more accuracy, openness, and honesty in our economic relationships.
                    Our system does not accept the artificial pretense of paying for digital content itself.
                    Donors at Snowdrift.coop are funding

                    The <dfn>Snowdrift Dilemma</dfn> is a variation on the better-known <dfn>Prisoner's Dilemma</dfn>.

                <p>
                    For those unfamiliar with the original prisoner's dilemma metaphor,
                    imagine you and an acquaintance have been arrested for committing a felony.
                    After being separated, you are each asked to confess.
                    If you both confess, the police will convict both of you of the full crime.
                    But if you both stay silent, the police will not have enough evidence,
                    so you will face a lesser misdemeanor charge.
                    Clearly, you are best off if you do not confess.
                    But then they offer a deal: if you confess and the other prisoner refuses,
                    they will drop all your charges, and your testimony will be used to convict the other
                    prisoner &mdash; who will then get an extra harsh sentence for refusing to talk.
                    But, of course, the other prisoner gets the same offer!
                <p>
                    The dilemma is:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If the other prisoner refuses to talk, then it is best for you to confess.
                        You will go free.

                   <li>
                        If the other prisoner confesses, then you had better confess too.
                        Otherwise you'll get an extra harsh sentence.

                <p>
                    <em>So, it is best for you to confess regardless of what the other prisoner does!
                    Since both prisoners realize this, they will both confess.
                    The result isn't the worst case for each of them, but if they had both chosen
                    to stay silent, both would be better off.
                    <em> If only they really trusted each other&hellip;!

                <p>
                    Thankfully, even if people are totally self-centered,^{footnote 1}
                    we can build trust <em>if</em> the situation is recurring.
                    This is called the <dfn>Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma</dfn>.
                    It is worth cooperating to show you are trustworthy if doing so can convince others to cooperate in the future.
                    If others realize that deviating could break that trust, then everyone might learn to cooperate.
                    After all, it is better for each individual when everyone cooperates than when everyone deviates.

                <p>
                    Through many studies, the generally accepted best strategy in an iterated situation is tit-for-tat:
                    Be nice and cooperate, but if someone else defects, then you deviate next time.
                    Hopefully, they will get the message.
                    If they cooperate, then you will cooperate.
                    So tit-for-tat prefers cooperation but has a defensive strategy to deal with defectors.
                    Still, interactions between different strategies are complex.
                    It is easy for prisoner's dilemma situations to fall into cycles of non-cooperation.

                <p>
                    There are many real-world circumstances that have a setup similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma.
                    Economists use the metaphor when discussing problems
                    such as the <dfn><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons>Tragedy of the Commons</a></dfn>.
                    However, there are also many situations that seem similar but don't really fit this model.

                <p>
                    A similar but lesser-known metaphor in game theory is the <dfn>Snowdrift Dilemma</dfn>.
                    Imagine two drivers in winter coming from opposite directions up to a big snowdrift blocking the road.
                    It would be fair for both drivers to do their part and clear the snow together.
                    But if you can relax in your car while the other driver does all the work,
                    that would be nice (ignoring possible feelings of guilt^{footnote 2}).
                    Of course, if both drivers sit and wait for the other to do the work, that is the worst case for everyone.
                    So, unlike the Prisoner's Dilemma, choosing to cooperate while the other player defects is still better for you than if everyone defects.
                    The issue is: nobody wants to be the first to act. If you wait, you may get to freeload.

                <p>
                    These dilemmas are used as models for the study of various behaviors.
                    Applied to voluntary donation, different situations may be comparable to one or the other of these dilemmas.
                    A project at risk of failure can be like the Prisoner's Dilemma.
                    Your selfish best outcome would be for others to contribute so that the project succeeds without your donation.
                    And if others do not contribute and the project fails, you are also better off having not contributed;
                    a donation to the failed project would simply be lost.                    
                    If a project is stable, however, it may be more like the Snowdrift Dilemma.
                    You might selfishly hope to freeload, but donating still helps the project even if others don't join you.
                    At least your donation will make some difference and won't be wasted.
                    Of course, you'd most prefer if everyone chipped in.

                <p>
                    Of these two dilemmas, the Snowdrift setup is, understandably, more likely to lead to cooperation.^{footnote 3}
                    Obviously, changing the rules of the game can change players' decisions.
                    <strong>So we have tweaked the rules further in order to solve these dilemmas.
                    Snowdrift.coop is set up to maxize the payoff and minimize the risk when choosing to cooperate.

                    These hypothetical dilemmas assume that the participants are rational self-interested
                    actors who wouldn't feel guilty for causing someone else to take all the blame.
                    Of course, the existence of complex social emotions brings up questions about human biology.

                <p>
                    In the Snowdrift Dilemma, we want something done, so we may do it even if others are freeloading.
                    However, real people do not just do rational cost/benefit analysis when faced with these social dilemmas.
                    We are complex and emotional.
                    We may choose to just be generous, but we still usually hope to be acknowledged and thanked.
                    If we feel unfairly exploited, we may choose to suffer ourselves just to punish the freeloader(s).
                    We may hold long-term grudges.
                    If there is widespread freeloading, we may lose trust in society, and become pessimistic, discouraged, and unmotivated.

                <p>
                    Although most of us are inclined to be generous and thoughtful of others,
                    when money enters the picture, it can displace these social considerations.^{footnote 4}
                    So for effective fundraising, we must set up the rules of the game to encourage cooperation and to maintain social sensibility.

                <p>
                    These issues are addressed in the design of most fundraising systems.
                    In a "walk-a-thon", the walkers aren't doing anything to directly help their cause;
                    the entire point is merely to show donors that everyone cares.
                    When everyone participates, it reduces the psychological problems caused by freeloading.
                    The more social the activies are, the better the likelihood of maintaining social norms over dispassionate market norms.
                    Of course, activities like walking are most meaningful when financial pledges
                    are based on how much walking is done and the distance is not predetermined.
                    This way, walkers can really feel that their actions make a difference,
                    and donors feel that everyone is proving their commitment to the cause.
                    There is also something to the feeling of accomplishment from having worked hard to achieve a goal.
                    So, effective fundraisers are designed for active participation.

                <p>
                    In addition to our donation-matching setup,
                    the other aspects of Snowdrift.coop are also designed to maximize social considerations and sense of community.

            <dd>
                <p>
                    The problem with the Snowdrift Dilemma is that nobody wants to do all the work,
                    so they are inclined to wait for others to contribute first.
                    But then after the first people contribute, others have incentive to freeload.
                    Our solution is to give donors a chance to say:
                    <blockquote>
                        <i>
                            "I want to contribute, but I know this project won't make it on just my donation.
                            Instead of paying all I can up front, I'll make a deal: I'll donate if lots of other folks chip in too."
                <p>
                    This is facilitated by the Snowdrift.coop system in which:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Donors first contribute funds to their private Snowdrift.coop account (from which they can withdraw unused funds).
                    <li>
                        Then, they select projects to which they pledge their support.
                    <li>
                        Contributions are not set amounts.
                        They start very low and each time a new donor pledges, the pledge amount for all donors goes <em>up</em>.
                    <li>
                        Thus, the amount <em>you</em> donate goes up when either you add a pledge or when someone else adds a pledge.
                        <em> In both cases, the increased funding that a project gets is <strong>more</strong> than what you put in!

                    <li>
                        Our formula for monthly pledge share amount is:
                        <div .math> $0.0001&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;lg(
                            <span .variable>G#

                            <span .variable>shares#
                            )#
                            &nbsp;+&nbsp;1#
                            )#
                            &nbsp;&times;&nbsp;#
                            (#
                            <span .variable>donors#
                            &nbsp;-&nbsp;1#
                            )
                        where
                        <span .math>#
                            <span .variable>G#
                            (#
                            <span .variable>shares#
                            ) #
                        is the geometric mean of the number of shares from each donor.
                    <li>
                        This formula has the following effects:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                With only a single share per donor, each will contribute 1/100 of a U.S. cent for each additional donor (not counting themselves).
                            <li>
                                The logarithmic function means that extra shares from a single donor are also matched,
                                but at a lower level than their initial share,
                                and this matching tapers off with increasing numbers of extra shares.
                                Thus, wealthier donors or institutions may contribute more without burdening others,
                                but they still get some community reinforcement rather than just contributing unilaterally.
                                Donors of multiple shares also send the message that they are matching single shares many times over,
                                thus further encouraging new donors to join.
                            <li>
                                Using the geometric average with the logarithm assures that all donors can make a significant impact when choosing to contribute extra shares.
                    <li>
                        This essentially solves the Snowdrift Dilemma by removing any incentive to delay donating.
                        Each pledge is an invitation to others to join and pledge as well.
                        This commitment builds trust without risk to those who step up first.
                    <li>
                        Of course, different projects may suggest that donors consider a certain number of shares,
                        such as for specialty projects that may be expensive to develop and have a smaller user base.
                <p>
                    The following graphs show how donation amounts and total funding increase with the size of the donor community.
                    <strong>For simplicity, these charts assume only a single share per donor.

                <div .row>

                    If each donor pledges just one share, then the contribution from each is simply the number of other donors times 1/100 of a cent.
                    In the chart below, the blue indicates a share amount, which is the same for a new donor and for each earlier donor.
                    Orange indicates a consistent 1/100 of a cent increase from a single earlier donor over the amount they had been contributing.
                    The rest of the matching comes from the same 1/100 of a cent increases from all the other earlier donors combined.

                <p>
                    Let's consider how this system affects the choices donors make.
                    Initially, you can choose to pledge or not.
                    Going ahead is encouraged because the pledge will be fully matched by the rest of the community.
                    The only catch is that we require you to help match future donors;
                    but let's consider if you had a choice whether or not to accept this condition.
                    When a new donor joins, your extra 1/100 of cent is not only matched once,
                    it is matched by all the other donors.
                    If you were willing to donate when matched one-to-one,
                    you should be thrilled to be matched 100-to-1 or 1000-to-1.
                    Everyone would choose to go ahead in this case, but only on the condition that everyone else had committed to this matching.
                    So by requiring this condition, we achieve a reliable system for the benfit of everyone.

                <p>
                    If you don't want to continue supporting a project, you are, of course, free to drop your pledge entirely
                    (knowing that everyone else will reduce their pledges as they will no longer be matching you).
                    If you choose to donate multiple shares, then you can choose to add or reduce your shares at any time.
                    The same matching pressures apply to extra shares but to a lesser extent, making this choice more flexible.

                <p>
                    <strong>Our iterative model calculates pledge amounts and pays out to projects on a monthly basis.
                    This gives donors a chance to build trust, to maintain long-term connections,
                    and to withdraw their pledges if they are not satisfied with the progress or communication of a project.
                    This setup provides stability to developers while keeping them accountable to donors.

                <p>
                    <strong> Why no set maximum donation amounts?
                    As discussed in studies of the prisoner's dilemma (and variants like the snowdrift dilemma),
                    when a fixed end or maximum is known, it leads to strategic gaming that reduces cooperation.
                    Also, consider how auctions work: people may think they only want to pay a certain amount,
                    but our perception of value changes when we see that others are willing to pay more.
                    <strong>For social negotiations to successfully achieve cooperation, flexibility is required from everyone.

                <p>
                    <strong> There are still effective limits.
                    Each donor contributes to their private Snowdrift.coop account,
                    and if their funds run out, then their pledges will be dropped by the system.
                    Effectively, this means they are not maintaining their social commitment,
                    and the system will then reduce the share value for everyone.
                    So there will be social pressure to add to their account and so continue their funding,
                    but Snowdrift.coop cannot force anyone to pay more than they are able.
                    Putting a larger amount into a dedicated funding account also allows for easier budgeting
                    compared to making separate budget decisions for each independant donation.

                <p>
                    We are also exploring options to allow share-splitting after levels get relatively high.
                    For example, an option could open for donating only bimonthly or quarterly.
                    We want to make sure that there is flexibility in the system.
                    Less wealthy donors should be able to continue and new donors to join at modest levels even for very successful projects.
                    The details of this mechanism have not been determined yet.

                <p>
                    We will also require projects to have public accounting and other transparency;
                    given this, if a project meets its funding goals and has no expansion plans,
                    then donor levels should stabilize as donors choose to focus on other projects.

                <p>
                    With Snowdrift.coop, no donor will be unfairly burdened,
                    and everyone will be encouraged to be an active part of the community.
                    There is no risk of contributing a lot to a project only to have it fail because others did not contribute.
                    Each donor will know that they are making a big difference because
                    <em> each new pledge gets everyone else to donate more!

                    As a cooperative, Snowdrift.coop will be member-run. Among other benefits,
                    this reduces problems with conflicts of interest when setting policy,
                    in contrast to other crowd-funding services.

                <p>
                    To further maintain social considerations, we also:
                    emphasize honor, morality, and ethics;
                    work to build a sense of community, cooperation, and trust;
                    encourage everyone to care about issues beyond own immediate interests;
                    and model these ideals in our own actions and policies.
                    We will have a system to give public thanks to donors and a way for them to indicate which features they would most like their pledges to support.
                    There will also be special acknowledgement of those in the community who make creative contributions to projects.

                <p>
                    By funding only Free/Libre Open Source Software and Free Cultural Works, we remove concerns about access to the funded results.
                    At Snowdrift.coop, donors need not be burdened to evaluate the terms of different licenses or worry about which project has which license.^{footnote 5}
                    All projects will be guaranteed to be freely available without problematic restrictions, so they are good long-term investments.
                    Our mission is to promote freedom by supporting the development of resources which serve the interests of the whole community.

                <p>
                    We value the ability of everyone to build on existing ideas in technology, science, and art.
                    Many wonderful things are achieved through the natural process of sharing and innovation.
                    Snowdrift.coop would not exist without the numerous past ideas upon which we are building.

                <p>
                    If explicit permission from authors is required for any modification of their work, changes quickly becomes impossibly burdensome.
                    Popular authors may simply not have time to review and approve every request.
                    After just a few levels of change by different people, it becomes completely impractical to get permission from all the past authors.
                    Quite simply, restrictions on use or modification make works less valuable.

                <p>
                    We can achieve broad collaboration only by automatically granting everyone the rights to access, share, modify, and redistribute.
                    Authors are still free to publish original versions or to express approval or disapproval of new uses and modifications
                    (for instance, there is the <a href="http://questioncopyright.org/creator_endorsed_mark">Creator Endorsed Mark</a>).
                    Furthermore, with a copyleft license &mdash; something we encourage projects to choose but do not require &mdash;
                    authors will also be assured the same access to any derivative versions made by others.

                <p>
                    Non-commercial clauses are also problematic.
                    For one thing, commerce should be encouraged. Economic activity is a good thing as long as it isn't destructive.
                    An NC license is also incompatible with other licenses that allow commercial use.
                    All of Wikipedia is licensed with CC-BY-SA;
                    which means you can use it for any purpose &mdash; including commercial &mdash;
                    if you give credit and license your derivative the same way.
                    Thus, NC-licensed material cannot be mixed with any content from Wikipedia or anything else with a CC-BY-SA license.
                    Because of this situation, NC licenses have the unintended side effects of hampering a lot of non-commercial use
                    and creating a rift in the commons.
                    Using a copyleft Share-Alike license is actually enough to stop the type of commercial exploitation that most people worry about.

                <p>
                    <strong>We are not stopping anyone from choosing other licenses if they want to fund them through other means.
                    Many mechanisms exist to enable authors to profit by wielding the power to restrict what others do with their work.
                    Snowdrift.coop exists precisely to be an alternative to that model.
                    We are giving the community a way to directly fund projects that the community wants.
                    <strong>If a project asks for community patronage, it is fair for the community to expect unrestricted access.

                <p>
                    Note: It is easy to be confused, but be assured:
                    <strong>These licenses have nothing to do with plagiarism or trademark issues.
                    Granting access and permission to change and distribute works does <em>not</em> permit false authorship claims.
                    The CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, and GFDL all require that the original author is given due credit,
                    that modified versions of works are clearly marked as modified,
                    and that any statements of endorsement are removed unless the modied version is independently approved by the endorser.
                    Authors also retain legal protections from slander and libel, the right to charge plagiarizers with fraud,
                    and the right to have their names removed from any derivatives with which they wish to be disassociated.

                    Of course, information about licenses will still be available. We will mark specially copyleft licenses.
                    Copyleft offers the benefit of keeping the same access and freedoms for all derivative versions,
                    but it has the downside of making it harder to integrate resources from different licenses.
                    We encourage the use of the primary copyleft licenses:
                    the GNU GPL for software, AGPL for online services, and Creative Commons CC-BY-SA for other works.

                <p>
                    Although we emphasize cooperation, we are not opposed to competition.
                    In fact, competition and cooperation are best when combined.
                    Within basic market economics, most interactions are cooperative.
                    We trade with others, collaborate, form partnerships&hellip;
                    Encouraging cooperation is in no way contradictory to our competitive free market system.

                <p>
                    <strong>We want competition.
                    Competition is among the most powerful of motivators.
                    Snowdrift.coop is itself competing with other platforms to be the best funding mechanism.
                    Within Snowdrift, projects compete for funding by appealing to donors.
                    Although the system is different from the physical market economy, it still involves competition and choice.

                <p>
                    What we don't want is destructive competition where success is achieved by hurting your opponents or keeping secrets.
                    As Richard Stallman puts it,
                    "competition itself is not harmful; the harmful thing is <em>combat</em>."^{footnote 6}
                    If you provide the best products or services,
                    you will succeed in a competitive and fair market even if you give everyone else access to your ideas.
                    This is the only honorable way to compete.

                <p>
                    We recognize the temptation to undermine competitors, and that is another of the dilemmas that we try to address.
                    As Dan Ariely wisely puts it,
                    <em>"it is easier to avoid temptation than to resist it."
                    By requiring transparency and Free/Libre/Open licenses, we reduce the temptation of many destructive competition strategies.
                    In essence, we help keep honorable people honorable.
                    Thus, everyone benefits from the sharing of ideas;
                    the way to succeed in the competition is to simply do the highest quality work;
                    and transparency helps assure that everyone still gets credit for their contributions.

                <p>
                    Another way to look at this: When we compete in a zero-sum game, we profit only by taking away from others.
                    In non-zero-sum situations, competition can involve completely positive, constructive actions.
                    Business, technology, and other creative work need not be zero-sum games.

                <p>
                    On a side-note: some skeptics wonder if Free Software and Free Culture are connected with "socialism".
                    Regardless of complex debates about the politics of that term, consider this:
                    The emphasis of Free Software and Free Culture is individual freedom (which includes the freedom to cooperate and coordinate).
                    The use and development of Free works is
                    <em>decentralized
                    and
                    <em>voluntary.
                    Free/Libre resources invite everyone to modify, use, and distribute in whatever manner they wish.
                    Rather than being a top-down directive, this allows for fluid and unrestricted innovation.
                    We want technology and culture to be controlled neither by governments nor by corporations.
                    However, we welcome both governments and corporations to be involved and to contribute to these developments &mdash;
                    as long as the end products are licensed to be open and respect freedom and liberty.

                    We have Snowdrift.coop with a focus on the particular issues surrounding digital works.
                    This is our primary focus and is a big enough challenge.
                    If we are successful with our initial focus, however,
                    there is a possibility that we will expand to fund other things consistent with the values for which we stand.
                    Also, the software that runs Snowdrift.coop and all of the writings and ideas are available for use by others
                    within the terms of the Free/Libre licenses we have chosen
                    (specifically the Affero General Public License and the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike licenses, respectively).
