    Each pledge is a matching offer to other patrons, current and future.
    So, when you pledge, others will help by donating more as well!
  <p>
    For each share, you will donate a monthly 0.1&cent; per other patron
    plus <em>some</em> more to help match extra shares that others pledge.
    You can adjust or drop your pledge at any time.
