        <h1>Welcome!
        <strong>
            We are creating a marketplace for independent
            <a href="@{WikiR "free-libre-open"}">free/libre/open
            projects.
        <p>
            We envision a world where software, cultural works (art, music, etc.), research, and educational resources
            are available to everyone without restictions on access, use, modification, or sharing.
        <p>
            To achieve this vision, we need core project teams with livable salaries
            supported by engaged and empowered communities.
        <p>
            Snowdrift.coop proposes a new kind of patronage system
            based on ongoing community-wide matching of small donations.
            We aim to involve as many people as possible,
            agreeing together to support the most deserving projects and hold them to the highest
            standards. Our system will be non-profit and governed as a community-owned cooperative.
        <p>
            We are not operational yet, but you can
            <a href="@{WikiR "about"}"> read more
            to understand all the details we have worked out so far.
        <h2>
            Join us!
        <p>
            We need help to make this successful, so if you might even 
            <em>consider
            getting involved, let us know!
            We have
            <a href="@{WikiR "how-to-help"}"> volunteer opportunities
            for everyone, regardless of your background.
            If you share our vision, you can help us realize it!
        <p>
            Thanks for your interest!
