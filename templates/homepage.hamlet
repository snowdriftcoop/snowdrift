            By coordinating, we can fund the progress we want without sacrificing our freedoms…

            Dwolla avoids credit-cards and has very low fees:
            <em>Free
            for payments under $10, otherwise 25¢.
            Unfortunately, Dwolla seems to require proprietary JavaScript,
            and you must <a href="http://refer.dwolla.com/a/clk/28gB5q">create a Dwolla account</a>.
