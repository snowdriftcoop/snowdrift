# Snowdrift Beginning Contributor's Guide

This guide is written to work for even novice programmers. Advanced readers may
adapt the instructions as they see fit.

## Get in touch!

Reading this guide is *not* a prerequisite to contacting us. Feel free to
connect and engage with real people in the community right away, if only to let
us know about your interest in contributing. See our [contact options].

## Licensing note

When you contribute patches to this repository, such as via a merge request, you
retain the copyright to your contributions. In doing so, you agree that the
patches are under under the same licenses we use (GNU AGPLv3+ for program code
and non-program text and graphics under CC BY-SA 4.0 International, as specified
in the [README]). Other compatible licensing can work with special notice.

## Prerequisites to contributing

* Decently powerful computer (probably less than 10 years old, ideally 4GB+ RAM)
* GNU/Linux, \*BSD, or macOS
    * We do not support Windows at this time. We suggest Windows users switch
      systems overall or use a virtual machine. If you really want to help test
      Snowdrift on Windows, our [Build guide] has some notes about that.
* Basic ability to use terminal command-line-interface (CLI)

## Working on the code

### Installing

**Follow the [Build guide]** to get Snowdrift going on your computer.

**All the following assumes you have done the initial clone and install
according to these instructions.**

### Text-editors and settings

Any code-appropriate text-editor will work, but we recommend those with stronger
Haskell and Yesod support. See [TEXTEDITORS.md] for our specific recommendations
and settings.

### Working with Git

Recommended workflow:

- Keep local master synced to the upstream main project master
- Do all work on new branches
- Use separate branches for independent work
- Once branches have been published and merge-requests opened, please retain the
  full list of commits and only rebase when requested.
- After you submit the merge request, someone should comment on your submission
  soon (hopefully within a few hours, maybe a day or two depending on timing).

If you're not comfortable in git and that doesn't make sense to you, see
[GIT-BASICS.md] for a more thorough explanation.

## Choosing what to work on

Several ways to get started contributing and/or to learn more overall:

* See the "newcomer-friendly" tag in our [issues] and consider working on any
  item not already assigned to someone and with no "blocked" tag.

* Play around with the site locally. See if you can understand what does what.
  You may find bits that seem incomplete or confusing, and you can explore them
  and/or check with others about the status, such as whether the issue is known
  or tickets exist already.

* Explore the code files and see if you can figure out how things fit together.

    * For non-Haskell work:
        * The .hamlet files in the /website/templates directory are comparable
          to basic HTML using white-space to avoid the need for closing tags
          (plus some other logic that connects to the Haskell). For more
          details, see the documentation on [Shakespearean Templates].
        * Any .julius files are containers for JavaScript.
        * For CSS, we use [Sass]

    * For those familiar with Haskell, one starting option: explore our files
      and update any code that doesn't match our code style described below.

* Read the code documentation in this repo and related pages on our [wiki].

* Read on below and check out links to learn more about the overall ecosystem,
  our development practices, and the tools we use.

## Development guidelines and notes

Overall, we strive to follow universal standards, be fully accessible,
and avoid browser-specific code.

### Design considerations

We have a separate [design] repo for design tasks, our design guide and so on.

### Visual grid overlay

The development mode includes a visual grid overlay that appears at viewport
widths corresponding to the grid widths in design mockups. This can be used to
compare the production pages with mockups to position elements and maintain
vertical rhythm.

Currently the grid overlay appears at the following widths:

* 750px: 8-column grid
* 390px: 4-column grid

### Code style

We suggest using [brittany](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brittany) as a
code formatter. Besides that, consider:

* Sentence-case, 50-column Git commit headers (but no ending period)
    * include bits like "fixes SD-#" as appropriate when fixing a ticket
    * consider adding extra comments below commit titles
* Haskell-standard camelCaseNames (not C-standard underscore_names)
* Group qualified imports separate from unqualified imports, like:

    ```
    import System.IO (hFlush, stdout, stderr)
    import System.Log.FastLogger (toLogStr, fromLogStr)
    import Yesod.Default.Config (withYamlEnvironment, DefaultEnv (..))
    import qualified Control.Exception.Lifted as Exception
    import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as Char8
    ```

* Imports should be grouped into three paragraphs: "Prelude" or "Import" for
  those modules that need them, then external modules, and then internal
  modules.

* Additionally, you can use hlint to get suggestions for improving code style:

    ```
    stack install hlint
    hlint -XQuasiQuotes -XTemplateHaskell $FILE
    ```

### Code review

As a best practice, we want adequate code review for every merge before it goes
into the master code.

To help with code review, please choose to *watch* the main code repository at
[Gitlab] (and perhaps also the [GitHub] mirror if you use GitHub).
Then, you can make general and in-line comments about new code as it is
committed and before it goes into the master repository.

### Issue Usage:

* Before creating a new issue, make sure to search for relevant issues to avoid redundancy: 
  - if there *is* a similar issue, comment if you have suggested additions/changes to the issue 
  - if trivial changes, can modify issue directly
    - (changes to issues have no version history so please be very wary of any deletions without author's approval)
* Issues often need extra grooming (merging, updates, adding labels, etc): make sure label new issues as best you can, which will require getting familiar with existing labels

### Use of JavaScript

**We generally build with *progressive enhancement* in mind.** The site should
work with just HTML/CSS along with Yesod/Haskell server-side functions. Given
that basis, we can add JavaScript as appropriate for enhancement, considering
[Unobtrusive JavaScript]. Use of NoScript should never cause a broken
experience. All our JavaScript should be recognized by the FSF's [LibreJS plugin].

Although we haven't used them as of May 2018, we have considered [GHCJS] and
[PureScript] as options for more Haskell-connected ways to generate JavaScript.
If contributors want to work with either of those, we would happily accept that.
[Yesod JavaScript Options] explains further about those or other possibilities.

## Learning resources and helpful tools

For deeper understanding of various elements in our development,
here are some resources (nearly all fully-FLO):

*   The following WikiBooks are fully FLO (Free/Libre/Open) and include links to
    further resources as well. As they are wikis, you can and should *improve*
    them yourself as you read!

    * [Haskell Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell)
      â€” one of the few *featured* Wikibooks, the Haskell Wikibook is
      *exceptionally* high quality and among the best overall introductions to
      Haskell.
    * [A Quick Introduction to Unix](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_Quick_Introduction_to_Unix)
      is a practical overview of command-line and Unix basics.
    * [SQL Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structured_Query_Language)
      is a good general overview
    * [HTML Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/HyperText_Markup_Language)
      is a workable but dated intro (of course, countless HTML guides exist)
    * [CSS Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
      is pretty thorough though needs updating.
    * [JavaScript Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript)
      is incomplete, but seems a decent intro.

*   [CanIUse.com](https://caniuse.com/) is a reference website to check that all
    web features you use are compatible with various browsers and standards.
    The CanIUse data is fully FLO under a CC-BY license.

*   [The Yesod Book](https://www.yesodweb.com/book/) is the primary resource
    for learning about Yesod, the web framework we use to develop Snowdrift.

*   The [School of Haskell](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com) includes
    basic and advanced topics including some Yesod sections.

*   At Stack Overflow (which uses FLO licensing for content), see tags for
    [yesod](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/yesod) and
    [haskell](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/yesod)
    (and, of course, other topics like HTML, CSS, Sass, Git, and so on)

*   Alongside #snowdrift on freenode.net IRC, check out #yesod , #haskell ,
    and #haskell-beginners (among many other relevant channels).
