* [Roadmap]
* [What is Snowdrift?]

## Code repositories

The main repository for Snowdrift is https://git.snowdrift.coop/sd/snowdrift. We
are mirrored on GitHub, but you are encouraged to open issues and merge requests
at the main location.

## Contributing

Snowdrift.coop welcomes contributions of all sorts. Even contributors with no
technical experience can find ways to help. See our [how-to-help] page for more
info about volunteering (including in non-programming ways).

Our **[Contributor guide]** covers all the steps to getting started with the
code. It includes notes about our development practices, basic setup, and
introductory resources for those new to Git, Haskell, or even to programming
in general.

It talks about the following topics, summarized here:

### Building and testing the website

You can follow our [Build instructions].

### Filing and searching issues/tickets

Questions, bugs, and features are best handled in the [Issues] section of our
main repository. However, you are welcome communicate with us in whatever way is
most efficient for you.

### Communicating with us

* [Create an issue] on Gitlab *(preferred)*

* Create an issue on GitHub

* Email us at <community@snowdrift.coop> to discuss your volunteer interests

* Sign up on the [dev email list] (and perhaps [other email lists]), and send a
  message introducing yourself to the community

* Visit `#snowdrift` on freenode.net [IRC] for live chat

Please **ask for help** and/or let us know if anything seems confusing. We try
to provide as many communication channels as possible, and we're always happy to
help guide newcomers through making their first contributions.
