Snowdrift.coop
==============

[Snowdrift.coop] is a non-profit, cooperative platform for funding
Free/Libre/Open (FLO) works. Using a many-to-many matching pledge, we aim
to empower the global community to better promote freedom-respecting
projects of all sorts.

For the basic idea, see our [illustrated intro].

Other pages on the site explain our [mission] and include discussion and
research on issues like the [economics of FLO projects], the [incentives
behind donations], how our model departs from that of [other funding
sites], and more.

Contributing
============

Our [how-to-help page] includes further notes about the site and info about
volunteering (including in non-programming ways). We also have an
in-progress, self-hosted [ticket system].

Snowdrift.coop is built with **[Haskell]** and the **[Yesod web
framework]**, but even if you don't yet know Haskell, you may still
contribute basic HTML/CSS/Javascript work! We welcome contributions from
developers of all skill levels.

Whatever your background, we're happy to answer questions or get any
comments. Hop on #snowdrift at [freenode.net], and say hello!

Essential build instructions
----------------------------

Our code is hosted at the fully free/libre/open site
[git.gnu.io/snowdrift/snowdrift] but, for convenience and redundancy, we
also mirror at [GitHub], a popular but proprietary platform.

Beginners with minimal technical background should follow our [Beginners'
Snowdrift Set Up] which can get anyone started making basic contributions.
It also includes links and info to help learn more about the tools we use.

### Install options

An easy way to build the site is to use a virtual machine via our [Vagrant
setup]. Vagrant works for nearly all operating systems.

If you prefer to install locally, see our [Debian/Ubuntu setup
instructions] or our [GUIDE.md] file for other systems (including other
GNU/Linux distros and OS X). The GUIDE also includes technical notes and
details.
