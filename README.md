Main repository: [git.snowdrift.coop] (running GitLab CE)

We also have a mirror on [GitHub] but prefer issues and merge requests at the
main location.

## Contributing

Snowdrift.coop welcomes contributions of all sorts.

For ways to contribute outside of coding, see our [how-to-help] wiki page.

For code contributions, our **[contributor guide]** covers all the steps in
detail (including notes about our development practices, basic setup, and
resources for those new to Git, Haskell, or even to programming in general). The
following is an abbreviated summary:

* Follow our [build instructions] to build and test the software.

* File and search issues/tickets in the [issues] sections at git.snowdrift.coop.

* Connect with us in whatever way is most efficient for you. All questions,
    feedback, help requests, etc. are welcome.

### Communicating with us

* Email us at <community@snowdrift.coop> to discuss your volunteer interests.

* Sign up on the [dev email list] (and perhaps [other email lists]), and send a
  message introducing yourself to the community.

* Visit `#snowdrift` on freenode.net [IRC] for live chat (or the bridged Matrix
  room at `#snowdrift:matrix.org`)

* All public discourse is covered by our [Code of Conduct]
