Snowdrift.coop
==============

[Snowdrift.coop](https://snowdrift.coop) is a non-profit, cooperative platform
for funding Free/Libre/Open (FLO) works. Using a many-to-many matching pledge,
we aim to empower the global community to better promote freedom-respecting
projects of all sorts.

For the basic idea, see our
[illustrated intro](https://snowdrift.coop/p/snowdrift/w/en/intro).

Other pages on the site explain our
[mission](https://snowdrift.coop/p/snowdrift/w/en/mission)
and include discussion and research on issues like
the
[economics of FLO projects](https://snowdrift.coop/p/snowdrift/w/en/economics),
the
[incentives behind donations](https://snowdrift.coop/p/snowdrift/w/en/psychology),
how our model departs from that of
[other funding sites](https://snowdrift.coop/p/snowdrift/w/en/othercrowdfunding),
and more.


Contributing
============

Our [how-to-help page](https://snowdrift.coop/p/snowdrift/w/how-to-help)
includes further notes about the site and info about volunteering (including
in non-programming ways). We also have an in-progress, self-hosted
[ticket system](http://snowdrift.coop/p/snowdrift/t).

Snowdrift.coop is built with **Haskell** and the
**[Yesod web framework](http://www.yesodweb.com/)**,
but even if you don't yet know Haskell,
you may still contribute basic HTML/CSS/Javascript work!
We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels.

Whatever your background, we're happy to answer questions or get any comments.
Hop on #snowdrift at
[freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#snowdrift), and say hello!


Essential build instructions
----------------------------

Our code is hosted at the fully free/libre/open site
[Git.GNU.io/snowdrift/snowdrift](https://git.gnu.io/snowdrift/snowdrift)
but, for convenience and redundancy, we also mirror at
[GitHub](https://github.com/snowdriftcoop/snowdrift),
a popular but proprietary platform.

Beginners with minimal technical background should follow our
[Beginners' Snowdrift Set Up](BEGINNERS.md) which can get anyone started
making basic contributions.
It also includes links and info to help learn more about the tools we use.

The easiest way to build the site is to use a virtual machine via our
[Vagrant setup](SETUP_VAGRANT.md).
Vagrant works for nearly all operating systems.

If you prefer to install locally, see our
[Debian/Ubuntu setup instructions](SETUP_DEBIAN.md)
or the [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md) file for other systems
(including other GNU/Linux distros and Mac OS X).
The GUIDE also includes further technical notes.
