00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,179
Things like
software, music, journalism, and research

2
00:00:04,189 --> 00:00:07,719
could be <i>public goods</i>
â€” <b>free</b> and <b>open</b> to all.

3
00:00:07,819 --> 00:00:09,915
But publishers who keep exclusive control

4
00:00:10,015 --> 00:00:12,880
can charge for access and sell ads;

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,638
while free public projects
get little or no funding.

6
00:00:17,738 --> 00:00:22,737
To solve this dilemma,
we need widespread, ongoing cooperation.

7
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:25,178
So we developed <i>crowd<b>matching</b></i>

8
00:00:25,188 --> 00:00:28,649
where patrons coordinate by
making their monthly donations

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,796
based on everyone matching each other

10
00:00:31,816 --> 00:00:35,302
If a project has few patrons,
each donates very little.

11
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:40,598
But they've all pledged to give <i>more</i>
for each additional patron who will come help!

12
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:43,295
If enough of us work together,

15
00:00:43,305 --> 00:00:46,043
we can clear the path
to a free and open future!
