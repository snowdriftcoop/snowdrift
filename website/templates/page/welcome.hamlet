      Funding free/libre/open projects
    <p>
      We support works that everyone can use, adapt, and share freely. But as
      public goods, anyone can freeride. And that presents a dilemma in
      getting funded. Our innovative platform brings people together to
      address this problem.

    <h1 .headline>
      Matching and sustainability
    <p>
      In a single pledge, crowdmatching combines the two most effective
      solutions for getting voluntary donations to public goods:
    <p>
      (A) matching donations where patrons agree to give together and
    <p>
      (B) sustaining memberships which provide reliable, long-term salaries
      and accountability.

    <h1 .headline>
      Democracy
    <p>
      We don't serve the concentrated power of advertisers, investors, or
      wealthy philanthropists. Both in our technical design and in running as
      a non-profit co-op, we work to empower regular citizens. By coordinating
      the resources of large numbers of patrons, we can ensure that the
      creative work we fund serves the public interest.
