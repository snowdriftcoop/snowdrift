  <h2>Registering New Payment Info
  <p>
    This page allows you to register a credit card with Stripe to become
    eligible to pledge as a crowdmatching patron.
<p>
  Snowdrift.coop does <em>not</em> hold or even touch your credit card
  information. The entry form widget is run by and goes directly
  to <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, which manages the money transfers.
<p>
  Use of this page (and this page alone on Snowdrift.coop) is governed by
  Stripe's <a href="https://stripe.com/us/legal">terms of service</a>,
  since this page uses their proprietary JavaScript code. In the upcoming
  beta platform, this will not be an issue.

<form method="post" id=#{paymentFormId} enctype=#{enctype}>
  <noscript>
    This page uses JavaScript to submit card information to Stripe. Without
    JavaScript, you cannot use this page. We're not happy about this compromise.
    It will change soon.
